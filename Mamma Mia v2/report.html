        <h2>Version 1</h2>
        <p>
            As the task was to create a simple web page for an imaginary costumer running a restaurant, and since it
            wasn't quite clear from the assignment-text whether this web page was to contain the menu only or to act as
            a
            full-fledged website for a business, we opted for the latter just in case (hoping we didn’t get lost in
            semantics on this one), which is why there is an "About"-section included. Moreover, since it is not unusual
            for restaurants and cafes to have their opening hours and contact details on their “Welcome”-page, and since
            it
            was explicitly highlighted in the assignment that these should be easy to find, we decided to include this
            both
            in <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> as well as <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> - in the latter too simply out of
            convention, since a lot of users probably would expect to find it there as well.
        </p>

        <p>
            To make it easier for users to navigate between the different sections of the web page, i.e. increase
            accessibility, a simple navigation bar with anchor-links was included. The web page has been built in
            such a way so that people can easily just use a keyboard to navigate it. Different kinds of headings
            have been implemented to make it even easier to orient oneself on the page. A lot of the structural choices
            that has been made should also be favourable with regard to SEO. In addition, in
            <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> we chose dark-colored headings and text on a light-colored, slightly blurred
            background to increase the contrast with the image behind, as it increases readability, e.g. for
            visiually-impaired and/or
            elderly people, while at the same time remaining visually pleasing. Big and not-too-heavily-stylised
            fonts, as well as a slight spacing between the letters and the elements themselves in
            <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, were chosen for the same reasons.
        </p>

        <p>
            The em-tag around the allergens was not used for its stylistic function, but for its semantic
            one, since a screenreader will stress the text within it. This was seen as a good idea since
            it’s safe to say that warning people of allergens in the dishes is very important.
        </p>

        <h2>Version 2</h2>
        <p>
            With the use of AChecker, we identified only one main problem and 28 potential problems. The main
            problem and most of these potential problems were linked to the image link as it was not
            working, which was to be expected considering that the file containing the image was not run
            through the check. Other problems were related to our “fake links”, which refers to the links
            that take the users to different sections of the web page, which is why we chose to ignore these
            errors. However, the check also showed that we didn’t use an HTML-image alt-tag with an
            image-tag. The reason for this would be that the image was linked to in the CSS-file. In theory,
            this isn’t a very big problem since the background image doesn’t convey information of any
            significant importance for the understanding of the content in this case. However, as there
            might be screenreader users who would prefer to know what’s depicted in the background, so we’ve
            chosen to include a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>-tag with an aria-label containing the alt-text as an
            alternative solution, as this is something a screenreader should be able to catch.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition, we changed the colors of the text in the header and footer from darker to lighter
            colors in order to make it more readable. We also made it easier to use on different devices by
            adding a viewport meta-tag. Links allowing the users to call the number or send an email to the
            address listed on the page were also added for convenience.
